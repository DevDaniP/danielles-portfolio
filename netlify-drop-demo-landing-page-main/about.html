        <h2>Hi, I'm Danielle</h2>
        
        <p>
          I'm a computer science student and data analyst who discovered my passion for 
          technology through an unexpected path. After 15 years across various industries—from 
          inventory management to greenhouse cultivation—I realized my favorite part of every 
          job was solving problems and optimizing systems. That realization led me back to 
          school, and I haven't looked back since.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Currently pursuing my BS in Computer Science at Southern Oregon University (3.91 GPA) 
          while working as an IT Analyst on campus, I've combined hands-on technical support 
          with intensive coursework in software development, data analysis, and AI engineering. 
          I completed a data analyst bootcamp where I mastered SQL, Tableau, and cloud platforms, 
          and now I'm working toward dual certifications in software and web development.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          What drives me is turning messy data into clear insights and complex problems into 
          elegant solutions. Whether I'm building a RAG-powered transcript search engine, 
          analyzing NBA scheduling data in R, or cleaning thousands of rows of layoff data 
          with SQL, I love the challenge of making technology work smarter for people.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me in Ashland, Oregon—hiking, exploring new 
          tech trends, or figuring out how to automate something that probably doesn't 
          need automating (but definitely should be).
        </p>
        
        <h2>What I Bring to the Table</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Technical Versatility:</strong> From Python and SQL to C++ and cloud platforms, I adapt quickly to new technologies</li>
          <li><strong>Real-World Problem Solving:</strong> 15 years of diverse experience taught me to see problems from multiple angles</li>
          <li><strong>Data-Driven Mindset:</strong> I don't just build things—I analyze, optimize, and iterate based on evidence</li>
          <li><strong>Collaborative Spirit:</strong> Whether supporting 100+ campus computers or working on team projects, I thrive in collaborative environments</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Currently seeking opportunities in:</strong> Data Analysis, Software Development, 
          or IT roles where I can combine technical skills with creative problem-solving.
